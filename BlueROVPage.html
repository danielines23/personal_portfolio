  <h2>Blue Anchor: Autonomous Docking for a BlueROV Heavy</h2>
  <h4>Daniel Lines, Aaron Marburg, APL UW</h4>
  <div class="project_desc">
    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>Autonomous docking is crucial for subsea systems such as wireless charging and data transfer for ROVs. The
      ability to control the ROV without human intervention opens up new possibilities for underwater operations, from
      monitoring tidal turbines to surveying telecommunication cables. This project aimed to address one aspect of this
      challenge: achieving autonomous docking for the BlueROV Heavy.</p>
    <h3>Key Components</h3>
    <p>Mapping and Localization Algorithms: Developed algorithms for mapping and localization using GTSAM and
      trilateration techniques.
    <p>
    <p>SLAM Implementation: Applied GTSAM for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and used fiducial markers to
      enhance localization accuracy.
    <p>
    <p> ROS Pipelines: Built robust ROS pipelines and RViz renderings with custom launch files to support ROV spatial
      awareness and navigation.</p>
