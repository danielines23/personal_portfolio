    <p>Hi, I am a senior at Cornell University studying Computer Science. Currently, I am interested in software
      engineering and robotics. Most recently, I was at the APL at The University of Washington working on localization
      algorithms for Autonomous Subsea Vehicles. Previously, I have worked at a manufacturing company building a
      database management system for assembly line production.</p>

  <h2>Featured Project</h2>

    <p><span class="project_heading">Blue Anchor</span> <br> <span class="project_members">Daniel Lines, Aaron Marburg,
        APL UW</span><br>Autonomous docking is crucial for subsea systems such as
      wireless charging and data transfer for ROVs. The ability to control the ROV without human intervention opens up
      new possibilities for underwater operations, from monitoring tidal turbines to surveying telecommunication
      cables.
      This project aimed to address one aspect of this challenge: achieving autonomous docking for the BlueROV Heavy.

      semesters as a TA for CS 3410, I am happy to annouce that I have accepted a position to TA for my first 4000
      level computer science class.
